    - São duas coisas que andam em conjunto :)
    - Quando uma empresa decide usar o Rocket.Chat ela precisa hospedar a plataforma em algum lugar, que pode ser tanto no servidor próprio ou quanto na nossa nuvem. O download pode ser tanto para integrar a Rocket no seu servidor, quando para baixar a plataforma no seu dispositivo. A partir disso você terá que usar o link do servidor que você está utilizando para funcionar :)
